###Discussion

We used a large global database (ForC), containing an unprecedented amount of data representing all major forest types (Fig. 1) and the nine most significant forest autotrophic carbon flux (FACF) variables (Table 2), to comprehensively explore how C cycling in mature, undisturbed forests varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. We test a suite of hypotheses, including many previously posed (Table 1), with more data and standardisation for factors that have not always been controlled for (*e.g.*, stand age, flux components measured) to gain a stronger understanding of climatic effects on FACF. We show that, across all nine FACF variables analyzed, C cycling decreases linearly with latitude (Figs. 2-3)--a finding that confirms multiple previous studies (**REFS**) but contradicts the idea that productivity of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests (**REFS**). The FACF variables increase in proportion to one another, with no differences in allocation detectable at this global scale and with component fluxes summing appropriately to larger fluxes (Fig. 3), indicating no major, systematic omissions or overestimations of flux components. However, we did detect a tendency for greater variability among subsidiary C fluxes (e.g., *$ANPP_woody$*, *$BNPP_{fine root}$*; Fig. 2; **some SI table?**; **discussed below??**). Climate explains a significant proportion of variation in all C fluxes analyzed (albiet less for subsidiary fluxes), with temperature variables being the best predictors of FACF on this global scale (Figs. 4-5). While other climate variables are significant predictors of FACF, none of them improve on the explanatory power of temperature-related variables in general or MAT specifically (Fig. 5). Water availability is an important factor in explaining FACF on a global scale: we find a positive influence of precipitation at low MAP, with saturation at higher levels of MAP (Fig. 5b) and a significant interaction between MAT and MAP for seven of the nine variables analyzed (Fig. 4). Temperature seasonality and growing season length are closely correlated with MAT and are strong predictors of FACF (Fig. 5e-f), though growing season length doesn't improve upon MAT as a predictor. Within the growing season, the influence of climate on C cycling is smaller but still significant for a number of carbon fluxes (**some SI table?**). These findings clarify the big picture of how FACF varies with latitude and climate on a global scale.

Past studies have differed in their conclusions regarding the relationship between productivity and latitude or its correlates (**REFS**)--quite possibly because of lack of standardization with respect to stand age and disturbance history. Our findings indicate that, among mature, undisturbed stands, FACF is unambiguously highest in the tropical regions, and the relationship is approximately linear (Figs. 2-3). This contrasts with suggestions that productivity of temperate forests is similar to that of tropical forests (**REFS**). Such observations may be attributable to the fact that temperate forests are predominantly secondary and of younger age than tropical forests (**REF**), so analyses comparing across latitudinal gradients without strict control of stand age tend to be comparing younger temperate stands with older tropical (and often boreal) forests ([Poulter et al. 2018-DOI:10.1594/PANGAEA.889943](http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/15361/)). Because C allocation varies with stand age (**REFS (KAT/NOBBY)**), age differences may introduce systematic biases into analyses of FACF across latitude or global climatic gradients. For example, woody productivity tends to be higher in rapidly aggrading secondary stands than in old-growth forests, where proportionally more C is allocated to respiration (**REFS**) [*purpose for respiration/ other compenents (**REFS????- NOBBY?**)]. By constraining our analysis to stands ≥100 years old with no record of major recent disturbance, we have clarified the shape of the relationship between FACF and latitude. 

[**NOBBY, please pay special attention to this paragraph**]. We show that FACF are broadly consistent in their responses to climate drivers on the global scale (with the exception of some differences in MAT-MAP interactions; Fig. 4), with no major trends in C allocation among the variable pairs tested (Fig. 2; **Some SI table**). Although variation in allocation has been observed along gradients of elevation [@moser_elevation_2011] and water availability [@newman_above-_2006]--along with non-climatic axes of stand age [@litton_carbon_2007], nutrient availability [@litton_carbon_2007; @gill_belowground_2016], and forest structure [@taylor_greater_2019]--variation in relation to climate is not apparent at the global scale within ForC, which contains the bulk of relevant data. Our conclusion, then, is that hypothesized gradients in allocation along global climate gradients cannot currently be supported for mature forests, although data quantity and standardization is currently insufficent to rule out the possibility that such trends exist. Of particular interest and significance are the relationships amongst $GPP$, net primary productivity ($NPP$ and its components, particularly $ANPP_{woody-stem}$), and respiration ($R_{auto}$ and components). There have been suggestions that tropical forests tend to have low carbon use efficiency ($CUE$= $NPP$/$GPP$=($GPP$-$R_{auto}$/$GPP$), which are based on observations of low $CUE$ in old-growth tropical forests relative to (mostly younger) extratropical forests [@de_lucia_forest_2007; [Malhi 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227837530_The_productivity_metabolism_and_carbon_cycle_of_tropical_forest_vegetation); @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016], but our analysis suggests that these low values might more appropriately be attributed to the fact that these forests are old than to their tropical climate. Indeed, $CUE$ is known to decline with forest age ([@de_lucia_forest_2007];**REFS(NOBBY)**) but appears to be roughly independent of $GPP$ [@litton_carbon_2007]. Among our sites with relevant data, there is indication in our data that CUE or $ANPP_{woody-stem}$/$GPP$ increase with latitude (**some SI table**). Careful methodological standardization across a consistent set of mature forest sites will be necessary to determine whether any climate-driven gradients in allocation exist at the global scale. 

One interesting observation was that climate tends to explain more variation in the major fluxes ($GPP$, $NPP$, $R_{auto}$ - latitude R^2≥48%) than in subsidiary fluxes (latitude R^2<27% for $BNPP_{fine.root}$, $R_{auto-root}$,$ANPP_{woody-stem}$) (Fig. 2; **some SI table?**). There are two non-exclusive potential explanations for this. First, it may be that methodological variation is larger relative to flux magnitude for some of the subsidiary fluxes. Belowground fluxes in particular are difficult to quantify, and measurement methods for the belowground fluxes considered here may be measured through fundamentally different approaches (*e.g.*, minirhizotrons, ingrowth cores, or sequential coring for $BNPP_{root-fine}$; root exclusion, stable isotope tracking, or gas exchange of excised roots for $R_{auto-root}$), and sampling depth is variable and often insufficient to capture the full soil profile. $ANPP_{woody-stem}$, which is also poorly explained by latitude or climate, is more straightforward to measure but is subject to variability introduced by differences such as biomass allometries applied, minimum plant size sampled, and exclusion or inclusion of branch fall (**?- Becky, did we end up lumping? REF**). However, methodological variation and uncertainty affect all of fluxes considered here--not necessarily any less than the aforementioned, and some of the larger fluxes that vary more strongly with respect to climate ($ANPP$, $NPP$) are estimated by summing uncertain component fluxes. Second, differences among variables in the proportion of variation explained by climate may be attributable to more dicrect climatic control over $GPP$ than subsidiary fluxes. That is, subsidiary fluxes may be shaped by climate both indirectly through its influence on $GPP$ and potentially respiration and directly through any climatic influence on C allocation, as well as by many other local- and regional-scale factors (**REFS**).

The latitudinal gradient in FACF (Figs. 2-3) is driven primarily by temperature-related climate variables, and secondarily by moisture availability (Figs. 4-5). Because many climate variables co-vary across the latitudinal gradient, because climatic drivers affect forest carbon flux on much shorter time scales than can be captured by annual climate summary variables, and because both climatic conditions and C flux vary intra- and inter-annually around the long-term means, it is not appropriate to attempt to identify any one mean annual climate variable as a mechanistic driver of FACF. However, it remains informative to consider these relationships. We find that temperature-related climate variables ($MAT$, temperature seasonality, ...**LIST**) explain the highest proportion of variability in productivity, and among these, $MAT$ is generally the best predictor--perhaps because site-specific MAT is recorded for the majority of sites in ForC, whereas other variables are extracted from global gridded data products (Table S1**?**). The effects of temperature are modified by moisture availability, with reduced FACF under hot and dry conditions (*i.e.*, high PET, high deficit; Fig. 5c-d) and sometimes under very high precipitaiton (Figs. 4, 5b). Negative effects of very high precipitation on FACF have been previously observed (**REFS**) and are attributable to nutrient and light limitations (**REFS**) Thus, although temperature and water availability jointly and interactively drive global-scale patterns of FACF. 

FACF is reduced by climatic seasonality (Fig. 5e), and productivity is shut down during cold- or dry- dormant seasons. To account for this, a number of analyses seeking to characterize global-scale effects of climate on productivity have examined the relationship of FACF per month of the growing season with growing season climatic conditions (**REFS**). We found that the sort of simple metric needed to define growing season at a global scale was uncertain for temperature and problematic for moisture (**WORK ON THIS**). A temperature-defined growing season length had stong positive correlation with FACF (Fig. 5f), but explained less variation than $MAT$. Dividing FACFs by growing season length to yield FACF per growing season month removed the majority of climate-related variation, supporting the idea that the latitudinal gradient in FACF is attributable more to shorter growing seasons at high latitudes than to inherently lower rates of photosyntheiss or respiration by high-latitude forests (*[ Enquist GCB review]*). However, there remained a number of significant correlations with growing season climatic conditions, suggesting that climatic conditions remain influential within the growing season. We conclude that while correcting for growing season length takes analyses a step closer to mechanistic linkage of instantaneous C flux rates to environmental conditions, it remains very crude relative to the the timescales on which climate affects plant metabolism and does not advance statistical predictive power. Rather, mechanistic accounting for climatic effects on global productivity patterns requires models representing physiologically meaningful timescales (*e.g.*, **refs**).

**[needs strong concluding paragraph]**
[Our analysis holds some important implications for our understanding of how forest carbon cycling relates to climate and, by extension, how it is likely to respond to climatic warming. We see no evidence that there are major differences in how the various components of forest autotrophic carbon cycling relate to climate or, by extension, any distinct trends in C allocation across the global scale (Fig. 3). ]
