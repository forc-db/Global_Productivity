## Abstract

## Introduction
### Hypotheses

## Methods (summary?)
**Fig. 1** - Map showing all data used in the anlysis, coded by variable.

## Results
**All major C fluxes increase with decreasing latitude (and altitude) and associated climate variables.** (see preliminary [figures](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/tree/master/results/figures/test/best_model) and [results](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/blob/master/results/global_trend_models_weighted_model.csv))
  - best fit is often polynomial, shapes vary (in potentially interesting ways)
  - some variation as to which are the best predictor variables

**Fig. 2** - multi-panel plots similar to [these](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/tree/master/results/figures/test/stacked_plots) showing (a) GPP = NPP + R_auto, (b) NPP = ANPP + BNPP, (c) ANPP = ANPP_foliage+ ANPP_woody_stem (+ ANPP_woody_branch + ANPP_repro) (d) BNPP, BNPP_root_fine, hopefully R_root
  
**Variables sum (approximately) as expected.**
  - Sum of statistical models for component models falls within confidence intervals for larger flux. 
  - Fig. 2

**Climate / latitude explains a larger portion of variation in major fluxes (GPP, NPP, and Rauto) than in subsidiary components.**
  - R2  ~ 0.7 for GPP, NPP, less for subsidiary components 
  - in model where mean and variance are scaled, both R2 and slope are highest for major fluxes, lower in subsidiary components
