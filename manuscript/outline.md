## Abstract

## Introduction
### Hypotheses

## Results
All major C fluxes increase with decreasing latitude (and altitude) and associated climate variables (see preliminary [figures](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/tree/master/results/figures/test/best_model) and [results](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/blob/master/results/global_trend_models_weighted_model.csv))
  - best fit is often polynomial, shapes vary (in potentially interesting ways)
  - **Fig. 1** - plot of major variables against latitude - some version of [this](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/blob/master/results/figures/test/best_model/Effect_of_lat_MATURE_only_age.greater.than.100_1.tiff)
  
Climate / latitude explains a larger portion of variation in major fluxes (GPP, NPP, and Rauto) than in subsidiary components
  - R2  ~ 0.7 for GPP, NPP, less for subsidiary components 
  - in model where mean and variance are scaled, both R2 and slope are highest for major fluxes, lower in subsidiary components
  - ** Fig. 2** - bar plot or table showing R2 and slope (preferably with CIs) by variable

Variables sum as expected
  - ** Fig. 3** - multi-panel plot with [stacked plots](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/tree/master/results/figures/test/stacked_plots) showing (a) GPP = NPP + R_auto, (b) NPP = ANPP + BNPP, (c) ANPP = ANPP_foliage+ ANPP_woody_stem (+ ANPP_woody_branch + ANPP_repro)
