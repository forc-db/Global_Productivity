## Abstract

## Introduction
*Hypotheses*

These are the null hypotheses:

H1. C fluxes vary in constant proportion to one another across major climate gradients (i.e., C allocation climate-invariant)

H2. Climate explains the same proportion of variability in C fluxes (i.e., the relative importance of climate is invariant)

## Methods (summary?)
**Fig. 1** - Map showing all data used in the anlysis, coded by variable.

## Results
**All major C fluxes increase with decreasing latitude (and altitude) and associated climate variables.** (see preliminary [figures](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/tree/master/results/figures/test/best_model) and [results](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/blob/master/results/global_trend_models_weighted_model.csv))
  - best fit is often polynomial, shapes vary (in potentially interesting ways)
  - some variation as to which are the best predictor variables

**Fig. 2** - multi-panel plots similar to [these](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/tree/master/results/figures/test/stacked_plots) showing (a) GPP = NPP + R_auto, (b) NPP = ANPP + BNPP, (c) ANPP = ANPP_foliage+ ANPP_woody_stem (+ ANPP_woody_branch + ANPP_repro) (d) BNPP, BNPP_root_fine, hopefully R_root
  
**Variables sum (approximately) as expected.**
  - Sum of statistical models for component models falls within confidence intervals for larger flux.

[There are some modest differences in allocation across climate gradients (?)]

**Climate / latitude explains a larger portion of variation in major fluxes (GPP, NPP, and Rauto) than in subsidiary components.**
  - R2  ~ 0.7 for GPP, NPP, less for subsidiary components 
  - in model where mean and variance are scaled, both R2 and slope are highest for major fluxes, lower in subsidiary components

**Fig. 3** - bar plot or table showing R2 and slope (preferably with CIs) by variable

## Discussion

H1-

H2- 
- factors other than climate are important for determining allocation to subsidiary components
