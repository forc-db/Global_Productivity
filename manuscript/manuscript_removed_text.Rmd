1. **Which climatic variables are the most important drivers behind the latitudinal pattern in primary productivity?** To date, the majority of studies have focussed on productivity responses to precipitation and temperature, while the influence of other climate variables on productivity remains under-explored. We utilise global climate datasets to investigate the relationships between productivity and a range of climate variables.  
2. **Do the components of primary productivity show variation in their responses to these climatic drivers?** Allocation to components of primary productivity appears to show some variation across climate and latitudinal gradients. We use global datasets of a range of primary productivity components to explore how significant this variation in allocation is.  
3. **Does climate explain the same proportion of variation in different components of primary productivity?** Review of current research shows that, while the relationship between GPP and latitude is consistent, NPP and ANPP show weaker relationships with latitude. This may be a result of varying sensitivities to climate drivers. We use mixed models to estimate the proportion of variation explained by climate for different components of productivity, to investigate how the relative importance of climatic drivers varies across components.  






*Which climatic variables are the most important drivers behind the latitudinal pattern in primary productivity?* All major carbon fluxes show similar responses to climate variables. Of the climate variables tested, annual wet days, aridity, cloud cover, mean diurnal temperature range and precipitation seasonality were poor explainers of variation in primary productivity, explaining less than 20% of the variation in each of the carbon fluxes.
We found that both measures of mean annual precipitation used were significant (p<0.05) but poor predictors of productivity, explaining, with the exception of R~auto~, at most 37% of variation in carbon flux.   
  
Looking across all productivity components, the climate variables which explain the highest amount of variation in carbon fluxes are temperature seasonality, mean annual temperature, annual temperature range, and annual frost days. Vapour pressure deficit came out as a strong predictor for ANPP~woody stem~, and potential evapotranspiration was a good predictor for BNPP~root~ and ANPP~woody stem~.

**Mean annual temperature.** All carbon fluxes show a linear increase with temperature.  
**Temperature seasonality and annual temperature range.** These two climate variables are strongly correlated, and so only temperature seasonality is presented in figure 4. Productivity is highest where temperature seasonality = 0, and at an annual temperature range of 15$^\circ$C or lower. GPP, NPP, ANPP, and R~root~ show a polynomial relationship with both variables, and BNPP~root~ shows a polynomial relationship with annual temperature range. As seasonality increases, these variables show a more rapid decrease in productivity. ANPP~foliage~ and ANPP~woody stem~ show a linear relationship with both variables.  
**Mean annual precipitation.** Despite being a poor predictor of productivity, the results indicate that, for the majority of fluxes, productivity increases with precipitation, up until a saturation point at between 3000 and 4000mm annual precipitation, above which productivity starts to decrease. The notable exception to this is GPP: the model indicates that GPP continues to increase with precipitation up to measures of at least 5000mm annually (p<0.0001, R^2^ = 0.33. Data above this point is not available, but the model trend indicates that the saturation point for this model is around 5000mm mean annual precipitation.  
**Potential evapotranspiration.** All fluxes, with the exception of BNPP~fine root~ and R~root~ show a strong increase with potential evapotranspiration at values below 1000mm. Between 1200 and 1700mm productivity peaks, and begins to decrease at values above 1800mm.  
  
There was a significant interactive effect between MAT and MAP for GPP, BNPP~root~, BNPP~fine root~, ANPP, ANPP~woody stem~, and R~root~. There was a significant additive effect for R~auto~. NPP and ANPP~foliage~ showed no significant interactive or additive effect: including MAP as a second variable did not improve on the model including only MAT.  
  
For the variables which showed a significant interactive or additive effect between MAT and MAP, no other climate variable, in combination with MAT, significantly improved on that model. For NPP, there was a significant interactive effect between MAT and water stress months, with this model explaining nearly 5% more variation in NPP than MAT alone. However, for ANPP~foliage~, no multivariate model improved on the univariate model including only MAT.

*Do carbon fluxes vary in their responses to climate, particularly with regards to allocation between fluxes?* Of all the flux pairings tested, the only ones to show a significant relationship with latitude were ANPP:NPP (p<0.01, R^2^ = 0.44) and ANPP:BNPP (p<0.001, R^2^ = 0.33). In both cases, allocation to ANPP increased with latitude, with the lowest allocation to ANPP in the tropical regions. BNPP:NPP decreased with latitude, though this relationship was non-significant.
