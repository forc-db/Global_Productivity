###Abstract
Carbon (C) fixation, allocation, and metabolism by trees set the basis for energy and material flows in forest ecosystems and define their interactions with Earth's changing climate. 
However, we lack a cohesive synthesis on how forest carbon fluxes vary globally with respect to climate and one another. 
Here, we draw upon **#** records from the Global Forest Carbon Database (ForC), representing all major forest types and the nine most significant autotrophic carbon fluxes, to comprehensively explore how C cycling in mature, undisturbed forests varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. 
We show that, across all flux variables analyzed, C cycling decreases linearly with absolute latitude -- a finding that confirms multiple previous studies but contradicts the idea that net primary productivity ($NPP$) of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests. 
C flux variables generally displayed similar trends across latitude and multiple climate variables, with few differences in allocation detectable at this global scale.
**Climate explained a significant proportion (#-#%) of variation in all C fluxes analyzed**, with temperature variables in general and mean annual temperature (MAT) in particular being the best predictors of C flux on this global scale. 
The effects of temperature were modified by moisture availability, with C flux reduced under hot and dry conditions and sometimes under very high precipitation. 
C fluxes declined with temperature seasonality, but growing season length did not improve upon MAT as a predictor.
Within the growing season, the influence of climate on C cycling was small but significant for a number of flux variables. 
These findings clarify how forest C flux varies with latitude and climate on a global scale. 
In a period of accelerating climatic change, understanding of the fundamental climatic controls on forest C cycling sets a foundation for understanding patterns of change.

### Introduction

Carbon (C) cycling in Earth's forests provides the energetic basis for sustaining the majority of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity and many human populations [@millennium_ecosystem_assessment_ecosystems_2005], while strongly influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and climate [@bonan_forests_2008]. 
Forests' autotrophic carbon fluxes--that is, carbon fixation, allocation, and metabolism by trees and other primary producers--sets the energy ultimately available to heterotrophic organisms (including microbes), in turn influencing their abundance [@zak_plant_1994; @niedzialkowska_species_2010] and possibly diversity [@waide_relationship_1999; @chu_direct_2018]. 
They are linked to cycling of energy, water, and nutrients, and, critically, influence all C stocks and define forest interactions with Earth's changing climate. 
Each year, over 69 Gt of C cycle through Earth's forests [@badgley_terrestrial_2019]-- a flux more than seven times greater that of recent anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions [9.5 Gt C yr^-1^; @friedlingstein_global_2019]. 
As atmospheric CO~2~ continues to rise, driving climate change, forests will play a critical role in shaping the future of Earth's climate [@cavaleri_urgent_2015; @rogelj_mitigation_2018]. 
However, our understanding of the climate dependence of forest C cycling on a global scale has been limited by analyses typically considering only one or a few variables at a time, insufficient parsing of related variables, and the mixing of data from forests that vary in stand age, disturbance history, and/or management status, all of which affect C cycling [@litton_carbon_2007; @gillman_latitude_2015; @simova_enigma_2017]. 

Forest C fluxes decrease with latitude [e.g., @luyssaert_co_2007; @piao_forest_2010; @gillman_latitude_2015; @li_mapping_2019], but it remains unclear whether and how the shape of this relationship varies among fluxes. 
For instance, gross primary productivity ($GPP$) increases continuously with decreasing latitude and is indisputably highest in tropical forests [@luyssaert_co_2007; @beer_terrestrial_2010; @jung_global_2011; @badgley_terrestrial_2019; @li_mapping_2019]. 
In contrast, some studies have suggested that net primary productivity ($NPP$), or its aboveground portion ($ANPP$), exhibits a less distinct increase from temperate to tropical forests [@luyssaert_co_2007]--or even a decrease [@huston_global_2009, but see @gillman_latitude_2015]. 
A shallower increase in $NPP$ than in $GPP$ with decreasing latitude would align with the suggestion that tropical forests tend to have low carbon use efficiency [$CUE$= $NPP$/$GPP$; @de_lucia_forest_2007; @malhi_productivity_2012; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016].
However, accurately comparing relationships of multiple forest C fluxes across latitude requires a large database with standardization for methodology, stand history, and management, which to date has not been possible.

The latitudinal gradient in forest C flux rates, along with altitudinal gradients [@girardin_net_2010; @malhi_variation_2017], is driven primarily by climate, which is a significant driver of C fluxes across broad spatial scales [@luyssaert_co_2007; @cleveland_relationships_2011; @hursh_sensitivity_2017].
The majority of studies have focused on exploring the relationships of C fluxes to mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP), as the most commonly reported site-level climate variables. 
There is strong evidence that both MAT and MAP show significant positive relationships with C fluxes [@chu_does_2016]; however, as with latitude, we lack synthetic understanding of how these relationships vary across climate fluxes. 
C flux increases strongly with $MAT$ on the global scale, but whether they saturate or potentially decrease at higher temperatures remains disputed.
In the global data compilation of Luyssaert et al. [-@luyssaert_co_2007], $GPP$ increased linearly with MAT, whereas $NPP$ saturated at around 10$^\circ$C MAT. 
In contrast, Larjavaara and Muller-Landau [-@larjavaara_temperature_2012], find that increases in $GPP$ saturate at approximately 25$^\circ$C MAT, while Schuur [-@schuur_productivity_2003] finds that $NPP$ increases continuously with temperature. 
Various measures of primary productivity saturate at high levels of MAP, though the saturation points identified vary from 1500mm [@luyssaert_co_2007] up to 2,445 mm MAP [@schuur_productivity_2003]. 
Interactions between MAT and MAP are also possible; within the tropics, there is a positive interaction between MAT and MAP in shaping $ANPP$, such that high rainfall has a negative effect on productivity in cooler climates, compared to a positive effect in warmer climates [@taylor_temperature_2017]. 
Such complicated dynamics play out with belowground fluxes as well, with typically dominant soil temperature mediated by moisture and C supply [@hursh_sensitivity_2017; @xu_contribution_2016]. 
There is also evidence that C fluxes also respond to climate variables such as cloud cover [@taylor_temperature_2017], solar radiation [@beer_terrestrial_2010; @fyllas_solar_2017], and potential evapotranspiration [@kerkhoff_plant_2005]; however, these are not typically assessed in global-scale analyses of annual forest C flux. 

As metrics of annual climate, MAT and MAP fail to capture variation in climate on an intra-annual scale, including temperature and precipitation seasonality and growing season length. 
Some studies have suggested that the apparently strong relationship between MAT and C fluxes is actually a consequence of the correlation between MAT and growing season length [@kerkhoff_plant_2005; @michaletz_convergence_2014; @michaletz_drivers_2018]. 
Kerkhoff et al. [-@kerkhoff_plant_2005] and Michaletz et al. [-@michaletz_convergence_2014] found no significant relationship between growing season temperature and net primary productivity (loosely defined to include a mix of **VARIABLES**) standardized to growing season length.
While this suggests that the influence of temperature may be limited to determining the length of the frost-free growing season, *analysis with clearly defined variables and standardized forest ages would be necessary to test the the veracity and generality of this hypothesis.  

The recent development of the Global Forest Carbon database (ForC), which synthesizes multiple variables and including records of stand history [@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016; @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018], opens up the possibility for a standardized analysis of global scale variation in multiple C fluxes and the principle climatic drivers of these patterns.
In order to approach this broad topic, we simplify the major gaps in our knowledge to five broad questions and corresponding hypotheses (Table 1).
First, we ask how nine forest autotrophic carbon fluxes in ForC vary with latitude.
We then test how these fluxes relate to MAT and MAP, and additionally how they respond to other, less well-studied, climate variables.
Finally, we consider the relationship between C flux and seasonality, considering the role of seasonality in explaining variation in carbon fluxes, and the influence of climate on C flux standardized by growing season length.

### Materials and Methods  

*Forest carbon flux data* 

This analysis focused on nine C flux variables included in the open-access ForC database (Table 2) [@anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016; @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018]. ForC contains records of field-based measurements of forest carbon stocks and annual fluxes, compiled from original publications and existing data compilations and databases. Associated data, such as stand age, measurement methodologies, and disturbance history, are also included. The database was significantly expanded since the publication of @anderson-teixeira_forc_2018 through integration with the Global Soil Respiration Database [@bond-lamberty_global_2010]. Additional targeted literature searches were conducted to identify further available data on the fluxes analyzed here, with particular focus on mature forests in temperate and boreal regions, which were not included in the review of @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016. We used ForC v3.0, archived on Zenodo with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3403855. This version contained 29,730 records from 4,979 plots, representing 20 distinct ecozones across all forested biogeographic and climate zones.

This analysis focused on mature forests with no known history of signficant disturbance or management. 
There is evidence that stand age influences patterns of C flux and allocation in forest ecosystems, and can confound relationships between latitude and primary productivity [@de_lucia_forest_2007; @gillman_latitude_2015]. To reduce any biasing effects of stand age, we included only stands of known age $\ge$ 100 years and those described by terms such as "mature", "intact", or "old-growth". 
Since management can alter observed patterns of C cycling [@simova_enigma_2017], sites were excluded from analysis if they were managed, defined as plots that were planted, managed as plantations, irrigated, fertilised or including the term "managed" in their site description. 
Sites that had experienced significant disturbance within the past 100 years were also excluded. Disturbances that qualified sites for exclusion included major cutting or harvesting, burning, flooding, drought and storm events with site mortality >10% of trees. Grazed sites were retained.

```
  
  
*Climate data* 

ForC contains geographic coordinates associated with each measurement record and, when available, mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) as reported in the primary literature [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018]. Based on the geographic co-ordinates for each site, data on twelve climate variables--including MAT, MAP, temperature and precipitation seasonality, annual temperature range, solar radiation, cloud cover, annual frost and wet days, potential evapotranspiration (PET), aridity (MAP/PET), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)--were extracted from five open-access climate datasets: WorldClim [@hijmans_very_2005], WorldClim2 [@fick_worldclim_2017], the Climate Research Unit time-series dataset (CRU TS v4.03 [@harris_updated_2014], the Global Aridity Index and Potential Evapotranspiration Climate Database [@trabucco_global_2019], and TerraClimate [@abatzoglou_terraclimate_2018] (Table S1). From these data, we derived maximum VPD, defined as the VPD of the month with the largest deficit, and the number of water stress months, defined as the number of months annually where precipitation was lower than PET. Where site-level data was missing for MAT or MAP, we used values from the WorldClim (**[2?](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/issues/89)**) dataset.

**For consistency with previous studies (Table 1, *H5*),** length of the growing season was estimated to the nearest month, where growing season months were defined as months with mean minimum temperature > 0.5$^\circ$C. We experimented with a definition of growing season months including a moisture index, defined as (MAT - PET)/PET, > -0.95 [@kerkhoff_plant_2005; see also @michaletz_convergence_2014]. However, we found that including a moisture index had minimal effect on the estimates of growing season length, and so chose to exclude it. Monthly data for PET, precipitation, and temperature from  CRU v 4.03 [@harris_updated_2014] and solar radiation from WorldClim2 [@fick_worldclim_2017] were used to calculate mean monthly PET, precipitation, temperature and solar radiation during the growing season. Total growing season precipitation and solar radiation were also calculated. 
  
*Analyses*

The effects of latitude and climate on C fluxes were analysed using mixed effects models using the package 'lme4' [@bates_fitting_2015] in R v.3.5.1 [@r_core_team_r:_2018]. The basic model for all analyses included a fixed effect of latitude or climate and a random effect of plot nested within geographic area. Geographic areas--*i.e.*, spatially clustered sites--are defined within ForC using a hierarchical cluster analysis on the distance matrix of the sites and a cutoff of 25km [@anderson-teixeira_forc_2018]. We experimented with inclusion of altitude as a fixed effect, but excluded it from the final models because it added very little explanatory power--that is, the difference in AIC ($\Delta AIC$) relative to models excluding altitude was generally small (often $\Delta AIC$<2). Effects were considered signficant when inclusion of the term of interest resulted in $\Delta AIC \ge 2.0$ relative to a corresponding null model. All $R^2$ values presented here are marginal $R^2$ values, and refer to the proportion of variation explained by only the fixed effects. Specific analyses are as described below.

We first examined the relationship between latitude and C fluxes (Q1; Table 1). We tested models with latitude as a first-order linear term (corresponding null: model without latitude) and as a second-order polynomial or logarithmic term (corresponding null: model with latitude as a first-order linear term). We selected as the best model that with the highest $\Delta AIC$ relative to a null model with no fixed term. 

To test whether trends in component fluxes across latitude sum to match those of larger fluxes, regression lines for smaller component fluxes were summed to generate new estimates of larger fluxes. 
We then determined whether these summed predictions fell within the **95%** CI for the larger flux across the entire range included latitude. **(Becky, is 95% the correct number)**
Confidence intervals for the larger flux were calculated using the 'bootMer' function from the lme4 package [@bates_fitting_2015]. **(Helene asks for more details here: what does the function do? are CIs just based on uncertainty in regression?)**
This analysis was applied to the following sets of fluxes: (1) $GPP = NPP + R_{auto}$, (2) $NPP = ANPP + BNPP$, and (3) $ANPP = ANPP_{foliage} + ANPP_{stem}$. In addition, we estimated total belowground C flux (TBCF, not analyzed due to limited data) as $TBCF = BNPP + R_{root}$. 
 
Variation in allocation to component carbon fluxes along latitudinal gradients was explored for the following pairings: $NPP:GPP$, $ANPP:BNPP$, $ANPP_{foliage}:ANPP_{stem}$, $ANPP_{foliage}:NPP$, $ANPP_{stem}:NPP$, $ANPP:NPP$, and $BNPP:NPP$. **[issue 91](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/issues/91)**
For each set of paired fluxes, measurements taken at the same site and plot, and in the same year, were paired together, and the ratio of each pair of measurements calculated. The ratios were regressed against latitude and climate variables, using the linear model specified above. 
Cook's distance analyses were carried out for each of the models, and indicated that data from a few high-elevation sites were having a disproportionate influence on the regressions. Thus, models were re-run using only data from sites $\le$ 1000m.

We next examined the relationships of C fluxes to climate variables (Q2-Q4; Table 1). As with latitude, we tested both linear and polynomial fits for each climate variable. We tested relationships of each C flux (Table 2) against each climate variable (Table S1), but focus presentation--including focal hypotheses (Table 1)--on climate variables that explained >20% of variation in C fluxes. **Becky, please make this more specific. I drafted this based on the results, but its not very clear.** **BBL: I agree, not clear and might trigger reviewer concerns about tailoring hypotheses to significance.**

Multivariate models were used to investigate the potential joint and interactive effects of MAT and MAP on carbon fluxes. An additive model including MAP in addition to MAT was accepted when $\Delta AIC$ >2 relative to a null including only MAT as a fixed effect. An interactive model including an MAT x MAP interaction was accepted when $\Delta$AIC >2 relative to a null including MAT and MAP as fixed effects. 

To test whether and how C flux varied with climate when standardised by growing season length (Q5), we first standardized annual C flux by dividing by growing season length (as defined above). We then tested for correlations between these standardised fluxes and growing season climate variables, using only first-order linear models.

**All analyses were conducted in R (**Version**). Code and data necessary to reproduce all results are archived on GitHub....**

###Results

In total, we analyzed 1228 records from nine forest autotrophic C flux variables taken from forests that had experienced no major anthropogenic disturbances within the past 100 years. These records represented a total of **#** plots in 154 distinct geographic areas across all forested biogeographic and climate zones (Fig. 1, Table 2). 
  
*How does C flux vary with latitude?* 

All major carbon fluxes decreased linearly with latitude (Fig. 2; Table S2). Latitude was a strong predictor for many of the carbon fluxes--particularly the larger fluxes (Table S2). Specifically, latitude explained 64% of variation in GPP (n = 254, p<0.0001), 50% in NPP (n = 114, p<0.0001) and 45% in ANPP (n = 259, p<0.0001). The C fluxes that were most poorly predicted by latitude were $BNPP_{fine.root}$ ($R^2$=0.17) and $ANPP_{stem}$ ($R^2$=0.18). For all C fluxes, the relationship with latitude was better fit by the first-order linear model than by second-order polynomial or logarithmic models.

```

In general, smaller component fluxes summed approximately to larger fluxes across the latitudinal gradient (Fig. 2). That is, modelled estimates of $GPP$, generated from the sum of $NPP$ and $R_{auto}$; $NPP$, generated from the sum of $ANPP$ and $BNPP$; and $ANPP$, generated from the sum of $ANPP_{foliage}$ and $ANPP_{stem}$, fell completely within the confidence intervals of the regressions of field estimates of $GPP$, $NPP$, and $ANPP$, respectively.

There was little evidence of systematic variation in C allocation with latitude or climate (Fig. S3). Of 28 relationships tested (7 ratios among C flux variables regressed against latitude, MAT, MAP, and temperature seasonality), there were only five significant relationships, all with $R^2 \le 0.4$ (Fig. S3). **The proportion of NPP allocated to $ANPP_{foliage}$ decreased with latitude ($R^2=0.32$) and increased with MAT ($R^2=0.37$). The proportion of $NPP$ allocated aboveground ($ANPP$) decreased weakly with latitude ($R^2=0.11$) and temperature seasonality ($R^2=0.17$), while increasing with MAT ($R^2=0.11$).   **
   
*How does C flux relate to MAT and MAP?* 

All fluxes increased with MAT (all p<0.05; Figs. 3-4, S4-S5, Table S2). 
For eight of the nine fluxes, this relationship was linear.
For only one variable, $BNPP$, did a lognormal fit provide signficant improvement over a first-order linear relatinship. 
*As with latitude, MAT tended to explain more variation in the larger flux ($GPP$, $NPP$, $ANPP$, $R_{auto}$) and $ANPP_{foliage}$ (all $R^2$> 0.4) than in subsidiary and belowground fluxes ($ANPP_{stem}$, $R_{root}$, $BNPP_{fine.root}$; all $R^2$< 0.25).* **update this**
  
MAP was a significant (p<0.05) predictor of all fluxes (Figs. 4a, S4-S5; Table S2). 
However, it explained little variation: with the exception of $R_{auto}$, MAP explained at most 25% of variation in C flux. 
For five of the nine fluxes, a second-order polynomial model provided the best fit, while first-order linear and lognormal relationships provided each provided the best fit for two flxues. 
All fluxes increased with MAP up to at least 2000 mm, above which responses were variable (Figs. 4, S4-S5). 

There was a significant additive effect of MAT and MAP on $GPP$, $ANPP$ and $R_{auto}$ (Fig. 3, Table S3). Accounting for MAT, MAP had a substantial positive effect on $GPP$ and $R_{auto}$ and a small negative effect on $ANPP$. There was a significant interaction between MAT and MAP for $NPP$ and $ANPP_{stem}$ (Fig. 3, Table S3). The interaction was negative for $NPP$ and positive for $ANPP_{stem}$. For $ANPP_{foliage}$, $BNPP$, $BNPP_{fine.root}$, and $R_{root}$, MAP did not have a signficant effect when accounting for MAT (Fig. 3, Table S3). For the variables which showed a significant interactive or additive effect between MAT and MAP, no other climate variable, in combination with MAT, significantly improved on that model. {**need to confirm this given changes in MAT MAP results (or you could just drop the sentence.)**}
**BBL: this paragraph is pretty dense. Perhaps distill to a summary sentence and move rest to SI?**

*How does C flux relate to other climate variables?* 

Our results indicated that annual forest C fluxes were most strongly explained by temperature at the global scale, with temperature-related climate variables coming out as strong predictors of C fluxes. In addition to MAT, several of its correlates (Fig. S2) were consistently identified as strong univariate predictors of C fluxes: temperature seasonality, annual temperature range, annual frost days, PET, and length of growing season (Figs. 4, S4-S7).  
  
All C flux variables were signficantly related to potential evapotranspiration. $ANPP_{foliage}$, $BNPP_{fine.root}$ and $R_{root}$ increased linearly with PET; however, all other fluxes showed a polynomial relationship with PET (Fig. 4c, S4-5; Table S2). We found strong evidence for a saturation point or peak with PET: C fluxes tended to increase at values below 1000mm, before saturating between 1200 and 1700mm. There was also evidence that some C fluxes begin to decrease at values above 1800mm PET.

Vapour pressure deficit was a significant predictor of all C fluxes. 
$BNPP_{fine.root}$ showed a linear relationship with vapour pressure deficit ($R^2$ = 0.07, p<0.05), but all other fluxes showed a polynomial relationship (Figs. 4d, S4-5; Table S2). 
C fluxes initially increased with vapour pressure deficit, before saturating at around 0.8 kPa, after which point they began to decrease.

All fluxes, with the exception of $R_{root}$, showed a positive linear relationship with solar radiation (Figs. S4-S5, Table S2). Solar radiation explained a low proportion of variability in all C fluxes, explaining less than 20% of the variation in each flux, with the exception of $R_{auto}$ ($R^2$ = 0.26, p<0.05).
  
Annual wet days, cloud cover, and aridity were poor or non-significant explainers of variation in C fluxes, explaining less than 20% of the variation in each of the carbon fluxes (Figs. S4-S5; Table S2).

*What is the role of seasonality in explaining C fluxes?* 

Temperature seasonality was, overall, the best predictor of annual C fluxes. **(update this paragraph based on new results)**
$GPP$, $NPP$, $ANPP$, and $R_{root}$ exhibited a polynomial relationship with seasonality (all p<0.05; Figs. 4e, S6-7; Table S2). $ANPP_{foliage}$, $ANPP_{stem}$ and $R_{auto}$ decreased linearly with temperature seasonality (all p<0.05; Figs. 4e, S6-S7; Table S2). Temperature seasonality was strongly correlated with annual temperature range, which was likewise a similarly strong predictor of C fluxes (Table S2). 
C fluxes were highest where temperature seasonality = 0, and at an annual temperature range of 15$^\circ$C or lower. **BBL: perhaps put this into an ecosystem context; what are these? Aseasonal subtropical places?**

In contrast, there was no significant effect of precipitation seasonality on C fluxes, and both maximum vapour pressure deficit, and water stress months were poor or non-significant predictors of variation in C fluxes (Figs. S6-S7; Table S2).

We found a significant relationship between length of growing season and C fluxes, with all fluxes showing a linear increase with length of growing season (Figs. 4e, S6-S7; Table S2). Length of growing season was a strong predictor of C fluxes, explaining 51% of variation in GPP, 39% of variation in NPP, and 34% of variation in ANPP, but it was a weaker predictor than MAT for all fluxes analysed (Table S4).

*Within the growing season, how do C fluxes vary with climate?* 

When annual C fluxes were standardized by growing season length (in monthly increments), correlations with growing season climate--including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and PET--were generally weak (Figs. S8-S9). Specifically, $ANPP$ increased with growing season temperature ($R^2$ = 0.10, p<0.001) and precipitation ($R^2$ = 0.04, p<0.05). Similarly, $ANPP_{foliage}$ increased slightly with growing season temperature ($R^2$ = 0.16, p<0.01) and precipitation ($R^2$ = 0.09, p<0.05). Growing season solar radiation had a positive influence on $GPP$ ($R^2$ = 0.21, p<0.001), $NPP$ ($R^2$ = 0.21, p<0.001), $BNPP$ ($R^2$ = 0.16, p<0.001) and $BNPP_{fine.root}$ ($R^2$ = 0.12, p<0.01). Growing season PET had a positive influence on $GPP$ ($R^2$ = 0.15, p<0.01), $NPP$ ($R^2$ = 0.18, p<0.01), $BNPP$ ($R^2$ = 0.23, p<0.0001), $BNPP_{fine.root}$ ($R^2$ = 0.11, p<0.05), and $ANPP_{stem}$ ($R^2$ = 0.06, p<0.05). {**Becky, please verify/ edit the following:** There were no other signifcant correlations between growing season length-standardized C fluxes (9 variables in Table 2) and growing season climate (**which variables?**)}. 
  
###Discussion  

Our analysis of a large global database (ForC) reveals how autotrophic carbon fluxes in mature forests vary with latitude and climate on a global scale. We show that, across all nine forest autotrophic C fluxes analyzed, C cycling decreases continually with latitude (*H1.1*; Fig. 2)--a finding that confirms multiple previous studies but contradicts the idea that productivity of temperate forests rivals that of tropical forests [@huston_global_2009]. C fluxes generally increase in proportion to one another (*H1.2*), with few differences in allocation detectable at this global scale (Fig. S2) and with component fluxes summing appropriately to larger fluxes (Fig. 2), indicating no major, systematic omissions or overestimations of flux components. However, climate explained lower proportions of variability among subsidiary C fluxes (*e.g.*, $ANPP_{stem}$, $BNPP_{fine.root}$, $R_{root}$; Fig. 2; Table S2). 

Latitudinal variation in C fluxes is primarily attributable to temperature-related variables (*H3, H4*), particularly MAT (Figs. 3-4). Water availability is also influential, but generally of secondary importance across the climate space occupied by forests (Figs. 3-4). Temperature seasonality and growing season length are closely correlated with MAT and are strong predictors of C fluxes (*H4*; Figs. 4e-f, S2, S6-S7), though growing season length did not improve upon MAT as a predictor. Within the growing season, the influence of climate on C cycling is smaller but still significant for a number of C fluxes (*H5*; Fig. S9; Table S4).

These findings clarify how forest C fluxes vary with latitude and climate on a global scale. Past studies have differed in their conclusions regarding the relationship between C fluxes and latitude or its correlates (Table 1, *H1*)--quite possibly because of lack of standardization with respect to stand age and disturbance history. Our findings indicate that, among mature, undisturbed stands, forest C fluxes are unambiguously highest in the tropical regions, and the relationship with latitude is approximately linear (Fig. 2). This contrasts with the suggestion that productivity of temperate forests is similar to that of tropical forests [@huston_global_2009]. Compared to tropical forests, the temperate forest biome has experienced more widespread anthropogenic disturbance and has a larger fraction of secondary stands [@potapov_mapping_2008; @poulter_global_2018], so analyses comparing across latitudinal gradients without controlling for stand age risk confounding age with biome effects. In addition, because carbon allocation varies with stand age [@de_lucia_forest_2007; @anderson-teixeira_altered_2013; @doughty_what_2018], age differences may introduce systematic biases into analyses of C fluxes across latitude or global climatic gradients. For example, woody productivity tends to be higher in rapidly aggrading secondary stands than in old-growth forests, where proportionally more C is allocated to respiration [@de_lucia_forest_2007; @piao_forest_2010; @doughty_what_2018; @kunert_understanding_2019].

We show that C fluxes are broadly consistent in their responses to climate drivers on the global scale, with at most modest trends in C allocation among the variable pairs tested (Figs. 2, S3). 
This parallels the observation that C allocation across multiple C fluxes varies little with respect to climate along a steep tropical elevational gradient [@malhi_variation_2017; but see @moser_elevation_2011], 
and is not surprising given that trees face universal constraints in carbon allocation (**REFS**). 
The one trend in allocation that emerged from our analysis was a tendency for greater C allocation aboveground--and to foliage in particular--in warm tropical climates (Fig. S3). This is consistent with observations of increasing allocation to roots with declining temperature across a tropical elevational gradient [@moser_elevation_2011], 
and with observations and theory predicting relatively higher belowground carbon allocation at higher latitudes [@gill_belowground_2016].
It is also consistent with findings that as forest productivity increases, proportionaly more carbon is allocated to $ANPP_{foliage}$ relative to $BNPP_{fine.root}$ [@chen_allometry_2019] or $ANPP_{stem}$ [@hofhansl_new_2015]. **( check / comment on  @litton_carbon_2007 )** 

One previously hypothesized trend that was not supported by our analysis was that tropical forests tend to have low carbon use efficiency ($CUE$= $NPP$/$GPP$=($GPP$-$R_{auto}$/$GPP$), which is based on observations of low $CUE$ in old-growth tropical forests relative to (mostly younger) extratropical forests [@de_lucia_forest_2007; @malhi_productivity_2012; @anderson-teixeira_carbon_2016]. Our analysis, limited to mature forests, shows no such trend (Fig. S3). $CUE$ is known to decline with forest age [@de_lucia_forest_2007; @piao_forest_2010; @collalti_is_2019], but appears to be roughly independent of $GPP$ [@litton_carbon_2007]. (*This finding may have some important implications for modeling and our broader understanding. I'm not sure offhand how much theory has been built on the idea of low CUE in tropical forests because of warm temperatures...Helene is not aware of any.*)

**update this paragraph ([issue 78](https://github.com/forc-db/Global_Productivity/issues/78))** 
One interesting observation was that climate tends to explain more variation in the major fluxes ($GPP$, $NPP$, $R_{auto}$) than in subsidiary fluxes ($BNPP_{fine.root}$, $R_{root}$, $ANPP_{stem}$) as quantified by R^2^ (Fig. 2; Table S2). There are two, non-exclusive, potential explanations for this. First, it may be that methodological variation is larger relative to flux magnitude for some of the subsidiary fluxes. Belowground fluxes in particular are difficult to quantify, and measurement methods for the belowground fluxes considered here may use fundamentally different approaches in different sites (*e.g.*, minirhizotrons, ingrowth cores, or sequential coring for $BNPP_{fine.root}$; root exclusion, stable isotope tracking, or gas exchange of excised roots for $R_{root}$), and sampling depth is variable and often insufficient to capture the full soil profile. $ANPP_{stem}$, which is also poorly explained by latitude or climate, is more straightforward to measure but is subject to variability introduced by differences such as biomass allometries applied and minimum plant size sampled [@clark_measuring_2001]. However, methodological variation and uncertainty affect all of fluxes considered here, and some of the larger fluxes that vary more strongly with respect to climate ($ANPP$, $NPP$) are estimated by summing uncertain component fluxes. Second, differences among variables in the proportion of variation explained by climate may be attributable to more direct climatic control over $GPP$ than subsidiary fluxes. That is, subsidiary fluxes may be shaped by climate both indirectly through its influence on $GPP$ and respiration and directly through any climatic influence on C allocation, as well as many other local- and regional-scale factors (**REFS**).

The latitudinal gradient in forest C flux (Fig. 2) is driven primarily by temperature-related climate variables, the effects of which are moderated by moisture availability (Table 1, *H2-H3*; Figs. 3-4).  MAT and MAP have long been identified as primary global-scale drivers of C fluxes [@lieth_primary_1973; **REFS**; @taylor_temperature_2017]. It is not appropriate to attempt to identify individual mean annual climate variables as mechanistic drivers of C fluxes because many climate variables co-vary across the latitudinal gradient (Fig. S2), because climatic drivers affect forest carbon flux on much shorter time scales than can be captured by annual climate summary variables, and because both climatic conditions and C flux vary intra- and inter-annually around the long-term means. However, it remains informative to consider these relationships. Among the temperature-related climate variables, $MAT$ is generally the most strongly correlated with C fluxes (Table S2)--perhaps in part because site-specific MAT is recorded for the majority of sites in ForC, whereas other variables were extracted from global gridded data products, introducing spatial scaling errors.

This finding supports the continued focus on MAT as a primary--*albiet* not mechanistic--correlate of C fluxes. The effects of $MAT$ are modified by moisture availability, with reduced C fluxes under relatively dry conditions (*i.e.*, low precipitation; high vapour pressure deficit) and sometimes under very high precipitation (Figs. 3-4). **BBL: I feel like this is pretty repetitive of previous paragraph.** The observed positive interaction between MAT and MAP for $ANPP_{stem}$ on the global scale (Fig. 3) is consistent with an analysis showing a similar interaction for $ANPP$ in tropical forests, also with a cross-over point at ~20$\circ$C [@taylor_temperature_2017]. *(@sullivan_sensitivity_2020 show a decline in $ANPP_{stem}$ in sites with high max temperatures and limited moisture.)* However, we detect no such interaction for $ANPP$ or most other C fluxes, and we find a contrasting negative interaction for $NPP$ (Fig. 3), suggesting that more data are required to sort out potential differences in the interactive effects of MAT and MAP on C fluxes in the tropics.

Forest autotrophic C fluxes decline with temperature seasonality (Table 1, *H4*; Fig. 4e), and are minimal during cold- or dry- dormant seasons. To account for this, a number of analyses seeking to characterize global-scale effects of climate on productivity have examined the relationship of C flux per month of the growing season with growing season climatic conditions [Table 1, *H5*; @kerkhoff_plant_2005; @anderson_temperature-dependence_2006; @enquist_adaptive_2007; @michaletz_convergence_2014]. The sort of simple metric that has been used to define growing season at a global scale [@kerkhoff_plant_2005] is coarse with respect to temperature because it's calculated on a monthly timescale and problematic with respect to moisture because it doesn't capture temporal lags between precipitation and plant water use caused by storage in soil or snow. We found that a temperature-defined growing season length had strong positive correlation with C fluxes (Fig. 4f), but was never the best. Dividing annual fluxes by growing season length to yield average flux per growing season month removed the majority of climate-related variation, supporting the idea that the latitudinal gradient in carbon flux is attributable more to shorter growing seasons at high latitudes than to inherently lower rates of photosynthesis or respiration by high-latitude forests [@enquist_adaptive_2007]. However, there remained a number of significant correlations with growing season climatic conditions, indicating that climatic conditions remain influential within the growing season. We conclude that while correcting for growing season length takes analyses a step closer to mechanistic linkage of instantaneous C flux rates to environmental conditions, it remains crude relative to the timescales on which climate affects plant metabolism, and does not advance statistical predictive power. Mechanistic accounting for climatic effects on global forest carbon flux patterns instead requires models representing physiologically meaningful timescales [e.g., **REFS**; @longo_biophysics_2019].

Our analysis clarifies how forest autotrophic carbon fluxes vary with latitude and climate on a global scale, with some important implications for how forest carbon cycling relates to climate and, by extension, how it is likely to respond to climatic warming. 
Our findings show that higher temperatures with similar moisture availability result in a generalized acceleration of forest C cycling (Figs. 2-3).
This is consistent with observations of continental- to global-scale increases over time in $GPP$ [@li_mapping_2019] and $ANPP_{stem}$ [@brienen_long-term_2015; @hubau_asynchronous_2020], along with some C cycle components not considered here--tree mortality [@brienen_long-term_2015; @mcdowell_drivers_2018], soil respiration [@bond-lamberty_global_2010], and heterotrophic soil respiration [@bond-lamberty_globally_2018]. 
**DISCUSS/CITE [Wu et al. 2020]** [@wu_accelerated_2020] 
However, increasing C flux rates are by no means universal [e.g., @rutishauser_testing_2020; @hubau_asynchronous_2020], likely because other factors are at play, including changes to other aspects of climate, atmospheric pollution (CO~2~, SO~2~, NO~x~), and local disturbances. 
Carbon cycling is also likely to **(discuss new Sullivan paper that finds higher max temperatures associated to lower ANPP_stem)** [@sullivan_sensitivity_2020]
Moreover, forest ecosystem responses to climatic changes outside the temperature range to which forest communities are adapted and acclimatized will not necessarily parallel responses across geographic gradients in climate. 
Nevertheless, understanding of the fundamental climatic controls on C cycling sets a firmer foundation for understanding forest C cycle responses to accellerating climate change.
