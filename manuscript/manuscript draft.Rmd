### Methods  
1.	ForC database [@Anderson-Teixeira2018]
+ Used data compiled from existing literature
+ 
2.	Climate data
+	WorldClim [@Hijmans2005]; WorldClim 2: vapour pressure and solar radiation [@Fick2017]
+	CRU: cloud cover; annual frost days; potential evapotranspiration; annual wet days [@Harris2014]
+	Global Aridity Index and Potential Evapotranspiration Climate Database [@Trabucco2018]
+	TerraClimate: vapour pressure deficit [@Abatzoglou2018]
3.	Run models in R
+ Model specification: mixed model using the lme4 package in R. 
+ Model = response_variable ~ fixed_variable + altitude + (1/geographic_area/plot_name), weighted by koeppen climate area

#### Database  
Analyses were conducted on data contained in the open-access ForC database [@Anderson-Teixeira2016; @Anderson-Teixeira2018]. This database contains records of field-based measurements of forest carbon stocks and annual fluxes, compiled from previously published studies and existing databases (e.g. ORNL DAAC; Luyssaert etc?). Additional targeted literature searches were conducted to identify any further available data on primary productivity, with particular focus on old-growth forests in temperate and boreal regions.

*Data selection.* ForC contains measures of carbon stocks and fluxes; for the purposes of this analysis only measures of primary productivity were selected from the database. The variables selected were: GPP, NPP, BNPP (total root and fine root), ANPP (total ANPP, foliage, wood and woody stem). 
  
*[insert table here similar to in trop-forC paper, including information on productivity measures, methods used to estimate, components included etc]*
  
Sites were excluded from analysis if they were managed, defined as plots that were planted, managed as plantations, irrigated, fertilised or including the term "managed" in their site description. Sites that had experienced significant disturbance were also excluded. Disturbances that justified site exclusion were major cutting or harvesting, and/or burning, flooding, drought and storm events with site mortality >10% of trees.  
There is evidence that stand age influences patterns of primary productivity and carbon allocation in forest ecosystems [@DeLucia2007; @Gillman2015]. To reduce any biasing effects of stand age, stands under 100 years of age were excluded from analysis.  
  
*Methodological consistency.* The data in ForC is derived from a range of studies, often employing different methods. For this reason, criteria were introduced to standardise for differences in methodology. Where data was based on forest plot census measurements, studies which uses a minimum dbh measure of 10cm or greater were excluded from analysis.  
Estimates of total ecosystem primary productivity are based on measurements of the component parts of forest productivity. Since the components included in productivity estimates vary between studies, estimates of productivity were classified within the ForC database according to their components, and then filtered for analysis. Estimates of NPP were selected if they included foliage, branch, stem, coarse root, fine root and understory. Measures of NPP which included additional components were excluded. Estimates of ANPP were selected if they included foliage, stem growth and branch turnover. Any measures of primary productivity where components were unknown were excluded from analysis. 
  
*Climate datasets.* Where site-level data on mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and latitude were available in the primary literature, this data was compiled and entered directly into the ForC database. In addition to this data, climate data for each site was extracted from five open-access climate datasets.

*Model specification.* The effects of climate and latitude on primary productivity were analysed using mixed effects models using the package 'lme4' in R v. 1.1.463 (cite). The effect of each extracted climate variable on each measure of primary productivity was modelled by specifying the climate variable as a fixed effect. Site altitude was also included as a fixed effect. Random effect was stand nested within area. Data from the temperate regions was heavily skewed towards studies from the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. These forests have very high productivity, and so to reduce any bias from over-sampling of this region, the models were weighted according to the proportion of forest cover by Koeppen climate zone.
